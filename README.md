# figroll #

Figroll is a somewhat simple gem to ease your way into the use of environment variables for configuration. That said, it is not currently documented, and you should not use it just yet.

## Installation ##

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'figroll'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install figroll

## Usage ##

Wow. Just look at all this empty space. You should check back here soon, but not right now. Later than now, definitely. As in there isn't any documentation at the present moment.

## History ##

* 0.0.2 - Clean error message
* 0.0.1 - A prerelease for internal tire kicking
